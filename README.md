# Odin Recipes
A basic [website](https://sharonytlau.github.io/odin-recipes/) consists of a *main index page* and three
*recipe pages* (recipes are from [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/)).

The website is built with only HTML, implementing concepts covered in the [HTML
Foundations section](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations)
of the The Odin Project, including the *HTML boilerplate*,
*headings*, *lists*, *links*, and *images*.

Full guidelines of this project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes).
