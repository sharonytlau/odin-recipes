# Odin Recipes
A basic recipe website consists of **a main index page** and **links to three
recipes found on [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/)**.

The website is built with only HTML, implementing concepts covered in the [HTML
Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations)
section of the The Odin Project, including **the HTML boilerplate**,
**headings**, **lists**, **links**, and **images**.

Full guidelines of this project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes).
