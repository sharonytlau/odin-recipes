    href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24530/buttermilk-pancakes-ii/">
    recipe </a> by BURYGOLD from allrecipes. </p>
  
  <h2> Ingredients </h2>
  
    <ul>
      <li> 3 cups all-purpose flour </li> 
      <li> 3 tablespoons white sugar </li>
      <li> 3 teaspoons baking powder </li>
      <li> 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda </li>
      <li> ¾ teaspoon salt </li>
      <li> 3 cups buttermilk </li>
      <li> ½ cup milk </li>
      <li> 3 eggs </li>
      <li> ⅓ cup butter, melted </li>
    </ul>

  <h2> Steps </h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li> In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda,
      and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and
      melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to
      cook. </li>
      <li> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat.
      You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles,
      it's ready! </li>
      <li> Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, using a wooden spoon or
      fork to blend. Stir until it's just blended together. Do not over stir!
      Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup
      for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot. </li>
    </ol>
